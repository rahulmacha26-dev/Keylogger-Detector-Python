# 🛡️ Keylogger Detector Tool (Python)

A beginner-friendly cybersecurity project that simulates a sandboxed keylogger and builds a real-time detector using Python.  
Learn how keyloggers behave and how to detect them using process monitoring — all in a safe, controlled environment.

---

## 🔍 What This Project Does

This tool demonstrates:
- How a **basic keylogger works** (in a safe, sandboxed setup)
- How to **detect** suspicious keylogging activity via process scanning
- How to use **Python** for real-world security simulations
- (Optional) Add a **Tkinter GUI** for alerts and interaction

---

## 🚀 Project Features

- 🧪 **Simulated Keylogger** — Captures keystrokes using the `keyboard` module.
- 🔍 **Real-Time Detector** — Scans for suspicious processes using `psutil`.
- 🛡️ **Sandboxed Setup** — Logs only locally, no stealth features.
- 🖥️ **Modular Design** — Keylogger and detector run as separate modules.
- 💡 **Beginner-Friendly** — Clean code and documentation to learn from.
